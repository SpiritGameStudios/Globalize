## ðŸ“” About

Globalize is a small, dependency free* mod that allows modpack creators to add global datapacks to their modpacks.
All you need to do is put your datapack in the `datapacks` folder in your modpacks root directory and Globalize will automatically load it for you.

*\*Technically, Globalize does use the `fabric-api-base` module, as it is required to load a mod at all. You still won't need to install it though, at it is built into the JAR.*
